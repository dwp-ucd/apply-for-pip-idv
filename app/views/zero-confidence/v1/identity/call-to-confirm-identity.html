      <p>There is no deadline to confirm your identity but it’s important you do, so that we can pay you straight away if your claim is successful. We check everyone's identity to protect from fraud.</p>

      <p>You’ll need to give some details about yourself, for example:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your name</li>
        <li>your National Insurance number, if you have one (you can find this on letters about tax, pensions and benefits)</li>
        <li>your date of birth</li>
        <li>your address</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You’ll also need to answer some questions about yourself or events in your life, so that we can confirm your identity.</p>
